generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Golf I GTI)"
    start_year: 1976
    end_year: 1983
    description: "The original Volkswagen Golf GTI pioneered the hot hatchback category, combining practical everyday usability with genuinely sporty performance in an affordable package. Based on the first-generation Golf, the GTI featured a fuel-injected 1.6-liter engine (later expanded to 1.8 liters) producing 110 horsepower—a significant figure for a compact car of the era—paired with a close-ratio four-speed manual transmission driving the front wheels. Visual distinctions from the standard Golf included subtle red trim around the grille, plaid 'tartan' upholstery, a golf ball-shaped gear knob, and modest body enhancements that hinted at the car's sporting character without excessive showiness. The lightweight construction (weighing just around 810 kg) contributed to exceptional agility and responsiveness, with lively acceleration and engaging handling that belied its practical hatchback roots. The interior maintained the Golf's functional design but added sporty touches including more supportive seats, additional instrumentation, and the distinctive plaid upholstery that would become a GTI tradition continuing through subsequent generations. The original GTI established the template for what a hot hatchback should be—practical enough for daily use but with the performance and driving dynamics to provide genuine driving pleasure on demanding roads—creating a new category that would be imitated by virtually every mainstream manufacturer in subsequent decades. Its influence extended far beyond its modest production numbers, fundamentally changing perceptions of what an affordable, practical car could offer in terms of driving enjoyment."
